	This is an order management system made for restaurants. It was made for a local restaurant of my community, based on their "analogic" system.
	It consist on a pyhton API build with Flask and an Angular app. 
	There are two types of accounts: one type for waiter and other for the counter. The counter type is the "master" account. It can create, update and delete the waiters account, and manage the orders: print tickets to send them to the kitchen and update the status of the order once is ready or delivered (or eventually cancelled).
	The waiter's account can only make new orders, and push them to the server as an object with the waiter name impregnated.
